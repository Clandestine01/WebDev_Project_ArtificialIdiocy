                        <p>Hubcap is a place where myself and other car enthusiasts like me can chat about all things cars! My name is John, and I mainly use this website to talk about the cars in my collection, as well as help people like yourself find the car that's right for them.</p>
                        <p>Down below you can find my posts and articles discussing various cars currently on the market. You'll also find opinion pieces, discussions on car history, and responses to any comments or queries folks have submitted.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of, if you feel like asking the great and mighty John (yours truly) any questions you might have, then you can do so at the Contact page found along the bar up above. You'll also find my About page there, talking a little more about myself and my business.</p>
